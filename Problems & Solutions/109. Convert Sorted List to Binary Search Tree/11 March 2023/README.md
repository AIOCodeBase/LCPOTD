# **109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree**
**
## **Medium**

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert *it to a* ***height-balanced*** *binary search tree*.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/linked.jpg)```
Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
